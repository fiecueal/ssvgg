# SSVGG
The **S**nappy **SVG** **G**UI!

Inspired by [Dotgrid](https://100r.co/site/dotgrid.html) and [GodSVG](https://github.com/MewPurPur/GodSVG)

## TODO
- feature parity with Dotgrid
- resizable window
- more layers
- edit existing segment
- use other tags like `<rect>` and `<circle>`
- language-agnostic icons instead of words in menu(also maybe)
- `H` and `V` for cardinal lines

## Why?
Dotgrid is an amazing tool for making simple SVG icons but I find myself wanting more out of it. The exports are also bigger than they need to be. There are also a few bugs that I want to get rid of but the original code is a little messy(and it doesn't seem like updates are happening anymore) from Hundred Rabbits so I'm starting from scratch instead.

GodSVG is another spin on a simple SVG editor that was made to export clean SVG files and give more convenient controls for usage such as the ability to use other tags besides `<path>` or edit already existing segments. But it's still incomplete and feels clunky to use(the last time I tried it) and doesn't have the feel of Dotgrid which I like more.

Another reason why I'm making this is because I don't know how to work with Canvas API and want to learn so this seemed like a fun undertaking. But I hope I can make this at least better than Dotgrid.
